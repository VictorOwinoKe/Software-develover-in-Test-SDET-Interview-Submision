### Task 3: e-commerce platform Tests
Certainly! Here's a README for the provided e-commerce test script:



# E-commerce Product Sorting Test

### Description

The `quicksort_products` function takes a list of products and an optional `ascending` flag, which determines whether the products should be sorted in ascending or descending order based on their prices. The function uses the Quicksort algorithm (O(n log n)) to sort the products and returns a new list of sorted products.


##To use the provided product sorting functionality:

1. Define a list of `Product` objects, where each product has a name (string) and a price (decimal).
2. Call the `quicksort_products` function, passing the list of products and the desired sorting order (`ascending=True` for ascending order, `ascending=False` for descending order).
3. The function will return a new list of products sorted based on their prices.
4. You can then iterate through the sorted list to access the sorted products.
